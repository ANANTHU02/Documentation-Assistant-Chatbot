# Documentation-Assistant-Chatbot

A smart AI-powered documentation assistant that helps users quickly find answers to their questions about product documentation.
Built with Python, NLP, and Streamlit.

🌟 Features

Natural Language Processing: Understands user queries in plain English
AI-Powered Responses: Uses a neural network model to match questions with the most relevant documentation
Interactive Web Interface: Clean, responsive UI built with Streamlit
Easy Deployment: Run locally or deploy to the cloud with minimal setup
Customizable Knowledge Base: Train the model on your own documentation

🛠️ Technologies

Python: Core programming language
NLTK: Natural language processing for text analysis
Keras/TensorFlow: Neural network model for question classification
Streamlit: Web interface and deployment
NumPy: Numerical operations and data processing

📋 Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher
pip (Python package installer)


🔄 Training Process
The assistant works through several steps:

Data Processing: Tokenizes and lemmatizes the documentation questions
Feature Extraction: Creates bag-of-words representation of queries
Model Training: Uses a neural network to classify questions
Response Generation: Matches user queries to the most relevant predefined answers


📊 Model Architecture
The neural network model consists of:

Input Layer: Matches the size of the word feature vector
Hidden Layer 1: 128 nodes with ReLU activation
Dropout Layer: 0.5 rate to prevent overfitting
Hidden Layer 2: 64 nodes with ReLU activation
Dropout Layer: 0.5 rate
Output Layer: Softmax activation for classification


🎯 Customization
You can customize the assistant by:

Updating the dataset: Add more questions and answers to improve coverage
Adjusting the threshold: Modify the confidence threshold in the get_response function
Model architecture: Change the neural network layers in the create_model function
UI customization: Modify the Streamlit interface in the main function

📈 Future Improvements

Add search functionality for documents
